# Week-2-homework
Using CSS and Bootstrap create a responsive web design that renders well on a variety of devices and screen sizes. 

## Goals
*   Functional, depolyed application
*   Build a habit of frequent commits to Github with meaningful commit messages
*   Practice CSS and Bootstrap

### Process
1)  Build Structure:
    *   Create basic colum/row structure for each page
    *   Add basic components to index page

2)  Copy finalized nav and footer to portfolio and contact pages

3)  Customize unique content for each page

4) Adjust for breakpoints



### Known Issues
*   Nav links do not function - RESOLVED
*   No style to indicate current page in nav bar
*   Nav and main content breaks do not work for small screen sizes
*   No line between title and content 
*   Message imput area in contact form is too small
*   Portfolio content incomplete

### Progress notes
*   Tried using the Bootstrap card component for main page content but having to force it to work.
*   I think I need to go back to the basic structure and rebuild the grid. I added Bootstrap components too quickly and got caught up in wrestling with modifying those before making sure my basic page structure was working.
